# COVID-Net
COVID-Net is a novel, deep Convolutional Neural Network model for improving COVID-19 detection. This project was a finalist for the 2023 Regeneron International Science & Engineering Fair and the 2023 Georgia Junior Sciences & Humanities Symposium.

Due to size limitations, the training/testing dataset cannot be uploaded onto GitHub. Please contact me if you would like access to this dataset.

COVID-Net is accessible for use on https://covid-net.anvil.app/. 

Note: The website will NOT work unless I have the backend Jupyter Notebook running. Please contact me if you would like to use the model.
