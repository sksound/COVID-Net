# COVID-Net
COVID-Net is a novel, deep Convolutional Neural Network model for improving COVID-19 detection. This project was a finalist for the 2023 Regeneron ISEF.

COVID-Net is accessible for use on https://covid-net.anvil.app/. 

Note: The website will NOT work unless I have the backend Jupyter Notebook running on my computer. Please contact me if you would like to use the model.
